Backtracking:

1. Backtracking is an improvement of the brute force approach. It systematically searches for a solution to the problem
among all available options. In backtracking we start with one possible option out of many available options and try to
solve the problem if we are able to solve the problem with the selected move then will print the solution else will back
track and select some other option and try to solve it.

2. It's a form of recursion

3. Backtracking can be thought as a selective tree/graph traversal method.

4. Interesting fact about backtracking is that we back up only as far as needed to reach a previous decision point with
an as-yet-unexplored alternative.

Examples:
1. Binary String: Generating Binary String
2. Generating k-ary strings
3. N-Queens Problem
4. The knapsack problem
5. Generalized strings
6. Hamiltonian Cycles
7. Graph Coloring Problem.
